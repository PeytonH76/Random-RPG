# Overview

First thing I noticed was how similar Java is to C++ and C#, so understanding it
came a lot faster. I created a program that is a random RPG generator. Since user input couldn't
work with gradle, I went to the random solution. There is a command interface and command
processor class. The command interface has commands that the program can call, and these commands will
be stored in a hashmap in the command processor class. There is a character parent class
that has multiple children for different characters in the RPG. Finally there is the
story class that will have the randomly generated story with all the other classes called in it. I
wrote this program to maily learn the Java language, and I wanted to do something that
I was interested in.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used AI to help me undestand and read the code better. I also
used the random, list, array list, and hash map libraries to be able to
store commands and get random data. Java is very similar to C++ and C#, so
it was easier to learn for me.

# Future Work

- Better the story
- Fix the user input reading for gradle
- Add more characters and random options
